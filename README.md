# hw2-professional-portfolio

Summary: 
<br>
The objective of this application is to function as a placeholder for future portfolio content and working applications. Principles of HMTL, CSS, and Git were employed. Please check back during the summer months of 2021, as content will be updated periodically. All past homework (1-6) and project 1 has been updated as of 6/29/21. For best results, render using Google Chrome.

Breakdown: 
<br>
Navigation links have been set up to scroll to the associated content. An "About Me" section highlights bio, interests, and hobbies. The current portfolio contains placeholder images which direct the user to pre-existing web applications such as Google. These applications will be updated periodically throughout the curriculum and finalized at the end of the course to reflect one's own work. "Contact Me" contains a fake number and email, but the GitHub and LinkedIn links are legitimate. Finally, a footer link has been added so the user can more conveniently return to the top of page.
